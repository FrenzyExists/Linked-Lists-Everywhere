<h3>:shipit: Oh Hello There! </h3>

<p align="center"> This is the second Data Structures Project üèó </p>

## TL;DR
This project has no script, no story, it is much more raw in terms of creating a data structure.

Therefore, three implementations: DLDHDTList, SLFLList and SLList. These are Lists that utilizes different Node Structures.
I won't much into detail, as the PDF provided by the professor explains better each one of them. But:

- DLDHDTList is an Index List that has two pointer Nodes: head and trailer, where each node has a pointer to the previous and next node
- SLFLList is an Index List with two pointer Nodes: first and last, each node is the standard node with a single pointer to the next node
- SLList is the simplest Index List from all, containing a single pointer Node: first, where each node is also the simplest type of node

In order to test these, you will need to run `IndexListTester` and `CloneTester`. You could run them in your favorite IDE, but if you desire to run it from the terminal:

`java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ~/path/to/project/p2_4020_4035_202/out/production/p2_4020_4035_202 IndexListTester`

and

`java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ~/path/to/project/p2_4020_4035_202/out/production/p2_4020_4035_202 CloneTester`

#### In case you find an issue, throw an issue on the github and I'll see what I can do :D
