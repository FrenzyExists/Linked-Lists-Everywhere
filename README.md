The second Data Structures Project I made during Data Structures, that's it

ATM you can't run anything as I haven't implemented any of the types of list. They gave us this like 2 or 3 days ago and I have other courses y'know :\

#### In case you find an issue, throw an issue on the github, and I'll see what I can do :D

## TODO ðŸ—’
- [ ] Finish the entire project
- [ ] Deploy, somehow (I have no idea how to deploy a java project lul)
- [ ] Create some kind of live-demo or something (Optional I guess?)

### NOTE
This repo is still under development, Just wait about a week or two, since that's kinda the deadline my professor gave me.
